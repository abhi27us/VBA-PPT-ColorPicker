  "body": "This is a simple color picker for PowerPoint VBA. I couldn't find a built-in color chooser for PowerPoint VBA, even though there IS one for Excel VBA (frustrating!), so I made this simple one that provides RGB editing with sliders, theme colors, and some standard colors.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/ericaddison/VBA-PPT-ColorPicker/blob/gh-pages/img/screenShot.png?raw=true\" alt=\"VBA-PPT-ColorPicker ScreenShot\"/>\r\n</p>\r\n### Launching the color picker\r\nIt is fairly straight forward to use. Functions for launching the color chooser are in the `ColorPickerUtils` module. \r\n\r\nTo launch the color chooser without a default color, you just need to call: `ColorPicker`\r\n\r\nTo set a default color with a single `Long` value, call: `ColorPicker 1234`\r\n\r\nTo set a default color with red/green/blue values, call: `ColorPicker 100, 100, 100`\r\n\r\n### Getting the color\r\nAfter the color picker is closed, you can retrieve the selected color with `SelectedColor` from the `ColorPickerUtils` module. The color is returned as a `Long` value, which is how VBA prefers to pass colors around.\r\n\r\n### Files\r\nThis is a list of the files, in order of relevance:\r\n* ColorPickerForm.frm: The `UserForm` file (along with the .frx file) for the ColorPicker dialog box.\r\n* ColorPickerUtils.bas: The `Module` file with functions to launch the dialog, retrieve the selected color, and convert colors to RGB.\r\n* ColorPickerDemo.bas: A small collection of examples for launching the ColorPicker, with and without initial colors.\r\n* SlideUtils.bas: A couple of simple routines for working with slides.\r\n* ColorPickerForm.frx: The binary file that accomanies the .frm form file.\r\n",
